This is a modern, interactive weather application that displays the current temperature and conditions for any city you enter, featuring dynamic backgrounds that change based on the weather.

**Features**

Intuitive User Interface: Clean and easy-to-use input field and "Get Weather" button.

Loading Indicator: A visual spinner appears while fetching weather data.

Custom Message Box: Provides user-friendly error messages and confirmations without using browser alert()s.

Smooth Transitions: Animations for background changes and content display enhance the user experience.

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Enter a City Name: Type the name of any city (e.g., "London", "New York", "Tokyo") into the input field.

Get Weather: Click the "Get Weather" button or press Enter.

The application will display the current temperature and weather conditions, and the background will update to match the weather.
